# Junior React Developer Assessment

## Objective

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to transform a Figma design into a functional, responsive React application, integrating data from an external API and optionally using Tailwind CSS for styling.


## Requirements 

1. Responsive Design
    *  The application should be fully responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
2. API Integration
    * Use https://fakestoreapi.com to retrieve product data.
    * Display this data in a way that matches the design and layout in Figma.
3. Optional (Plus): Tailwind CSS
    * Using Tailwind CSS for styling will be considered a plus, as it aligns with modern best practices and helps ensure responsive styling.


## Instructions
1. Implement the Design
    * Accurately replicate the provided Figma design using React components (https://www.figma.com/design/XUwCJMxmpe5FBurje9q41Y/Junior-React-Developer-Assessment-Template?m=auto&t=THdoZkkNy8WZyrMC-6).
    * Focus on details like typography, spacing, and colors to ensure the design matches Figma.
2. API Data
    * Fetch and display product data from https://fakestoreapi.com/products.
    * Fetch and display product categories from https://fakestoreapi.com/categories.
    * Ensure that each product displays relevant information (e.g., image, name, price) according to the design.
3. Responsiveness
    * Make sure the layout adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes.
    * Test the application on various screen widths to confirm consistent functionality and appearance.
4. Additional Considerations (Optional)
    * Using Tailwind CSS for layout and styling is a plus. If you use Tailwind, please add a brief README note explaining your setup.
    * If not using Tailwind, ensure the CSS is modular and cleanly organized.
5. Code Quality
    * Write clean, well-organized code with meaningful component and variable names.
    * Include comments if necessary to explain complex logic.

## Submission
You have to reply with your suggested solution ​within 3 days.​

* Share your solution source code with us using a ​github or gitlab
